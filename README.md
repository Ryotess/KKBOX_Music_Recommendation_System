This repository is the Top 30%/AUC > 0.68 solution for KKBOX recommender competition.  
We use feature engineering technigues such as SVD, outlier removal and recommendation theory: user-item matrix to reach the ranking.  
 
## Quick start

**!! Directly run the R file is not recommended!!**  

Instead, you can open the .ipynb(Python version) file to demo the project with a lower computation cost.  
If you have any technical problem, feel free to contact us.
